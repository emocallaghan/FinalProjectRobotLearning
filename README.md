So distance sensor still reading negative some times 
I made it so that when the touch sensor is triggered that the sensor pack displays as red and when the touch sensor is not triggered it draws as dark purple. I noticed from this that htesenso sometimes was red when NOT TOUCHING any walls. I am thinking that the order of updating might be what is causing both problems but I have yet to dig into this idea. Will continue to comment in this read me and commit code as I go along.

Additional adds are the ability to hit esc to exit the pygame window, the light is draggable, and walls can be drawn through click and drag.
 i have not implimented this yet tho
